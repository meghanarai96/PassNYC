PASSNYC is a not-for-profit organization that facilitates a collective impact that is dedicated to broadening educational opportunities for New York City's talented and underserved students. 
PASSNYC uses public data to identify students within New York Cityâ€™s under-performing school districts and, through consulting and collaboration with partners, aims to increase the diversity of students taking the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). 
Using Python Data Visualization techniques(Seaborn and Matplotlib),I am analyzing and identifying the various challenges students of New York face while taking the SHSAT.
